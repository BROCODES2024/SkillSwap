# Skill Swap Platform

A modern web application that enables users to exchange skills with others in their community. Share what you know, learn what you need!

## üéØ Problem Statement

In today's interconnected world, everyone has unique skills and knowledge to share, but finding the right person to learn from or teach can be challenging. Traditional learning platforms often require monetary transactions, creating barriers for skill exchange. Our Skill Swap Platform solves this by creating a community-driven ecosystem where users can:

- **Connect** with others who have complementary skills
- **Exchange** knowledge without financial barriers
- **Build** meaningful relationships through skill sharing
- **Grow** their expertise through mutual learning
